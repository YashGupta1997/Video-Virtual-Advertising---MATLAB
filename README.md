# Video-Virtual-Advertising---MATLAB

Virtual advertising is the use of image processing techniques to insert virtual advertising images into live or pre-recorded videos. For the placement and projection of such advertisements, 3D localization of the court lines is first detected and tracked. Also, the image is placed according to the position and orientation of the court lines. The advertisement image is then blended into the frame and all processed frames are fused into a video.
